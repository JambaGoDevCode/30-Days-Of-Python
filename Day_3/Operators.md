### Boolean

    A boolean data type represents one of the two values. True or False.
    The use of these data types will be clear once we start using the comparison operator.
    The first letter T for True and F for False should be capital unlike JavaScript.

### Operators

    Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

####    Assignment Operatiors:
    
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows thst values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below the different types of python assignment operators.

    Operator    Example     Same As
    =           x=5         x=5
    +=          x+=3        x=x+3
    -=          x-=3        x=x-3
    *=          x*=3        x=x*3
    /=          x/=3        x=x/3
    %=          x%=3        x=x%3
    //=         x//=3       x=x//3
    **=         x**=3       x=x**3
    &=          x&=3        x=x&3
    |=          z|=3        z=z|3
    ^=          z^=3        z=z^3
    >>=         z>>=3       z=z>>3
    <<=         x<<=3       x=x<<3




####    Arithmetic Operators:

    Addition (+): a + b
    Subtraction (-): a- b
    Multiplication (*): a * b
    Division (/): a / b
    Modulus (%): a % b
    Floor division (//): a // b
    Exponentiation (**): a ** b


    Operator    Name            Example
    +           Additon         x + r
    -           Subtraction     x - r
    *           Multiplication  x * r 
    /           Division        x / y
    %           Modulus         r % w
    **          Exponentiation  x ** y
    //          Floor division  x // r



See example in .py


####    Comparison Operators:

In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values.
We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value. The following table shows
Python comparison operators which was taken from w3shool.

Operator        Name                                    Example
__________________________________________________________________________
==              Equal                                   x==y
!=              Not equal                               x!=y
>               Grater than                             x>y
<               Less than                               x<y
>=              Greater than or equal to                x>=y
<=              Less than or equal to                   x<=y
