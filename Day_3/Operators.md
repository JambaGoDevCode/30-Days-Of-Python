### Boolean

    A boolean data type represents one of the two values. True or False.
    The use of these data types will be clear once we start using the comparison operator.
    The first letter T for True and F for False should be capital unlike JavaScript.

### Operators

    Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

####    Assignment Operatiors:
    
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows thst values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below the different types of python assignment operators.
