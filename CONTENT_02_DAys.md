## Day 2

### Built in functions

    In Python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally 
    available for your use that mean you can make use of the built-in functions
    without importing or configuring. Some of the most commonly used Python built-in-functions are the following: 
        
        print()     len()       type()      int()       float()     str()
        input()     list()      dict()      min()       max()       sum()
        sorted()    open()      file()      help()      dir()  
    
    In the following table you will see an exhaustive list of Python built-in 
    functions taken from Python documentation.

### Variables

    Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special caracter, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x,y,z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended. 

    Python variable name rules
    -   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore chareter
    -   A variable name cannot start with a number
    -   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0 - 9, and _)
    -   Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FisrtName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables.

    Here are some example of valid variable names:
        firstname
        lastname
        age
        country
        city
        first_name
        last_name
        capital_city
        _if # if we want to use reserved word as a variable
        year_2021
        year2021
        current_year_2021
        birth_year
        num1
        num2

    Invalid variables names

        first-name
        first@name
        first$name
        num-1
        1num

### Declaring Multiple Variable in a Line
    Multiple variables can also be declared in one line
    Gestting user inout using the input() built-in functions. Let us assign the data
    we get from a user into first_name and age variables.
